# Extra Oculus Keyboard Layouts

Modified version of https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/android12--mainline-release/packages/InputDevices/

Changes: 
- Different app name and package id, to not conflict with built-in keyboard layouts

## Building

Build project in Android Studio

## Limitations

Doesn't work in Settings, Quest Browser, Feed and potentially other Meta apps. As a workaround for browser you can use Wolvic instead.
